        <p>
          Hi! I’m Ra&uacute;l, I Have 21 years old and I’m a student of Computer Engineering at Inter-American University of Puerto Rico, Bayamón campus. I’m currently taking a minor concentration in computer science. One of my passions is to translate situations of everyday life into code, try to simplify them and make them fun. I like Science, in particular: particle physics. Someday I will visit the particle collider (CERN). I try to learn something new every day and I think that everything we learn is useful and works for us in some situation of our life. I would like to meet Elon Musk and learn from him because he is one of the people I consider most brilliant in the world.
          <br><br>
          Among my hobbies we can find: eating, going to the gym, programming, and my favorite, reading. I feel that books are universes capable of transporting us to another world, another story, another love, another life. I do not discriminate any book, I like study and teaching books as well as novels and history of any kind. Among my favorite books we can find the following books: The Count of Monte Cristo, Les Miserables, FOUR, Sapiens and how to win friends and influence people (there are more books).
          <br><br>
          someday I will create something that will help people. I want to improve the planet in which we live.
